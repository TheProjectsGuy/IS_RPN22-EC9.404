\section{Advantages of Bernstein Polynomials}

Bernstein polynomials have the following advantages over other methods

\begin{enumerate}
    \item It has smooth blending through the waypoints. This means that not only the function is continuous, and differentiable; but also its derivatives are continuous and differentiable.
    \item It can be quickly calculated, given a set of waypoints. If we do not want to solve any equations, we directly set the waypoints as control points.
    \item Applying a Euclidean transformation to the entire path is equivalent to applying the transformation to the control points alone. The weighed sum only depends on time (not space).
\end{enumerate}
