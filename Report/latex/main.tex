    This report describes the things learned in the Independent Study during the Spring 2022 session. The material is available on GitHub at \href{https://github.com/TheProjectsGuy/IS_RPN22-EC9.404}{TheProjectsGuy/IS\_RPN22-EC9.404}.

    \subsection*{Project Description}
    This project aims to study mobile robots in the context of planning and navigation in known and unknown environments. The aim is to explore aspects of mobile robotics: Motion models, trajectory generation, optimization, planning, and tracking. Overall, the study aims to discover the underlying mechanics of autonomous mobile systems. The study seeks to emulate the course outcomes of Robotics: Planning and Navigation (EC4.403) while exploring as much additional material as possible.
