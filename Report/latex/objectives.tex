\section{Learning Objectives}

The following learning objectives were achieved through this independent study

\begin{itemize}
    \item Modeling and control of different vehicle models
    \item Global path planning using sampling and search-based planners
    \item Local trajectory planning using third and fifth order spirals, Bezier curves (Bernstein polynomials), and other methods
    \item Local trajectory tracking using optimization techniques and various trackers
    \item Collision avoidance using time scaling, optimization constraints, and other methods
    \item Solve the assignments of course \texttt{Robotic Planning and Navigation - EC4.403}
\end{itemize}
