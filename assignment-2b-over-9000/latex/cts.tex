\section{Constant time scaling}

In general, we time-scale the velocities to reach the same point but at a later time. This causes us to avoid collisions \emph{while} not deviating from the desired path. Constant time scaling is implemented using the equation below

\begin{equation}
    \dot{x} (\tau) = k \: \dot{x}(t)
\end{equation}
